## Description
Web testing with Robot Framework and Selenium2Library:
`Robot Framework`__ is a generic open source test automation framework and
`Selenium2Library`__ is one of the many test libraries that can be used with
it. In addition to showing how they can be used together for web testing,
this demo introduces the basic Robot Framework test data syntax, how tests
are executed, and how logs and reports look like.

See `project wiki`__ for more information about running the demo, viewing
results, etc. You can also view the tests and generated results through the
wiki without running the demo yourself.
